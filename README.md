# Test code for verifying an ESP8266 binary for use with OTA

Using parts of the AxTLS library, I'm trying to get the ESP8266 to validate an binary sent via OTA.

It needs to decrypt the sent signature, and compare it to the computed hash.

So far, I've successfully had the SHA1 digest verified.

The SHA1 digest was generated by:

```bash
openssl dgst -sha1 -binary -out hash data.txt
```
